      <description>The Moonlight Movement is a growing workers movement building creative resistance to corporate power grabs and government corruption. Moonlight organizes accessible resistance based on the skills workers and people already have to provide services and care that should be basic protected freedoms.
We donâ€™t need another non-profit with a new twist, we are building a transformative framework of constructive organizing that is as much about keeping people safe as it is about building a new paradigm.</description>

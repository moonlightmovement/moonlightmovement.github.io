      <description>Project Overview Inaccurate airwaves are flooding government websites and broken media in Washington DC. Regular people are having trouble accessing accurate information on the government shutdown and how to fight back.
In honor of defending free press and National Banned Books week, the Moonlight Movement and allies are organizing the delivery of key anti-authoritarian books to little free libraries all around Washington DC. This organizing effort in partnership with book publishers, local groups, and more is aimed at educating residents of the nation&amp;rsquo;s capital on democratic backsliding, history, occupation, and resistance tactics as the attacks, abductions, and violations of the law by the current administration continue to escalate.</description>

      <description>4 year vision: Organize workers to use their skills to provide services to protect people from corporate greed and government overreach. Candidates 2025 We will be launching a slate of anti-authoritarian candidates for 2025-2026 at all levels of government inspired by a Zohran Mamdani-style smile and hustle politics with a gorgeous vision of the future. Immigrants, federal workers, and all the beautiful people the president is attacking will be at the heart.</description>

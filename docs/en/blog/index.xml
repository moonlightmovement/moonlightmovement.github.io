      <description>Definition of a parallel institution from the International Center on Nonviolent Cooperation: “Alternative [or parallel] institution-building is understood broadly as the process undertaken by organized civilians to establish new practices and organizations that are parallel to and aim to challenge dominant socio-economic, cultural, and political structures viewed as unjust and oppressive. Some examples include alternative schools; health clinics; publishing houses… proto-political and governing institutions, and community service organizations”.

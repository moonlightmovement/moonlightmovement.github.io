## Project Overview
Inaccurate airwaves are flooding government websites and broken media in Washington DC. Regular people are having trouble accessing accurate information on the government shutdown and how to fight back. 

In honor of defending free press and National Banned Books week, the Moonlight Movement and allies are organizing the delivery of key anti-authoritarian books to little free libraries all around Washington DC. This organizing effort in partnership with book publishers, local groups, and more is aimed at educating residents of the nation's capital on democratic backsliding, history, occupation, and resistance tactics as the attacks, abductions, and violations of the law by the current administration continue to escalate. 

### We are seeking donations of books with anti-authoritarian insights, themes, and frameworks for peaceful resistance. We are aiming to gather hundreds of books 

If you find a book in a Little Free Library, we encourage you to do several things:
1. Read the book and pass it to another library or local friend
2. Post on social media and tag @moonlightmvmt 
3. Donate books about organizing to little free libraries in and around DC
4. Find more books to read by supporting publishers including [Haymarket Books](https://www.haymarketbooks.org/), [New Press](https://thenewpress.org/?v=eb65bcceaa5f), and [PM Press](https://pmpress.org/)

The Moonlight Movement is a growing workers movement building creative resistance to corporate power grabs and government corruption. Moonlight organizes accessible resistance based on the skills workers and people already have to provide services and care that should be basic protected freedoms. 

We donâ€™t need another non-profit with a new twist, we are building a transformative framework of constructive organizing that is as much about keeping people safe as it is about building a new paradigm. Empowering workers and regular folks to lean into the skills they know well is necessary to continuing services, revealing government corruption, stopping full democratic backsliding, and instilling movement confidence to win. 

By uniting, training, and growing a new tide of expert leaders with a shared political analysis, and creating cohesive support and strategies to maximize their success, the Moonlight Movement is building transformative power to win a better world.
